-------------

12:00 - Starting with a 'walking skeleton' acceptance tests, in the style of GOOS.

12:35 - Have a trivial acceptance test working, but GOOS suggests that acceptance tests
should not reveal the domain language and details of dependencies. Going
to add a helper object to deal with this, and get the code more in line with
the first tests.

12:44 - Added a test helper that makes things look a bit more sane. Now time for a lunch
break.

13:33 - Return from lunch. Doing some basic code reorganization, and then will
begin working more on TicTacToe::Game object. Trying to follow the "Build from
the inputs to the outputs" approach recommended by GOOS, but it's not that easy.

14:06 - After making some minor refactorings on the basic player switching
functionality, I found my mind wandering to how I was going to implement win
condition checking. Wrote it on index cards rather than in code, to avoid
spiking.

14:14 - Ugly implementation of second integration test, time to quit for today.
NOTE: This should probably raise an exception at the Game level (or something
similar), and turn it into a message at the UI level.

11:23 - Going to sneak in a little work on the UI, will not need tests for that
because it's just display code for the moment.

12:00 - Ended up implementing a lot of view logic, maybe tests would have been a
good idea after all? Anyway, I will possibly throw out the code and try again
from a TDD angle next time I sit down.

Jordan suggests making the UI map to the keyboard numpad, which may not be a bad
idea.

09:40 - Jumped right in and started working on game rules around 9:00am. Trying
to wrap things up, seem to be driving everything through the acceptance tests,
and not sure if that's a good thing.

10:00 - It works! Will play test and do a code review tomorrow, possibly
introducing some cleanup and additional tests then.
