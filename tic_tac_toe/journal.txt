Starting with a 'walking skeleton' acceptance tests, in the style of GOOS.

12:35:

Have a trivial acceptance test working, but GOOS suggests that acceptance tests
should not reveal the domain language and details of dependencies. Going
to add a helper object to deal with this, and get the code more in line with
the first tests.

12:44:

Added a test helper that makes things look a bit more sane. Now time for a lunch
break.
