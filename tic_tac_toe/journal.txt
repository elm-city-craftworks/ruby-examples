-------------

12:00: Starting with a 'walking skeleton' acceptance tests, in the style of GOOS.

12:35: Have a trivial acceptance test working, but GOOS suggests that acceptance tests
should not reveal the domain language and details of dependencies. Going
to add a helper object to deal with this, and get the code more in line with
the first tests.

12:44: Added a test helper that makes things look a bit more sane. Now time for a lunch
break.

13:33: Return from lunch. Doing some basic code reorganization, and then will
begin working more on TicTacToe::Game object. Trying to follow the "Build from
the inputs to the outputs" approach recommended by GOOS, but it's not that easy.
